The goal of this project is to understand what factors are most important in influencing the price of a hostel bed. Some factors that will be explored are rating, number of reviews, city, and distance from city center.

The figure depicts hostel price as a function of one chosen feature, average rating. This linear relationship suggests that average rating may have an effect on hostel price, but is likely not the only factor. 

The figure shown is an analysis of 47 hostels in Medellin, Colombia. Further analysis will include data from 1500-2000 hostels throughout South America.
